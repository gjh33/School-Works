Viking Rush 90% of the scripts were solely my work. The only two that weren't are block manager and monster manager.
however those two files were heavily modified by me before the final version to bring them up to date.
I was responsible for assigning scripts, and breaking down the project into managable components.

Light game is 100% my material. Everything from shaders to scripts to graphics.
